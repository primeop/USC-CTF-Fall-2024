### **beer sales**
- **Challenge**: In August 2024, a lot of beer was sold in Orlando, Florida. The exact number of gallons sold was available on an open FTP server in a PDF. The task was to find the total gallons of beer sold.
- **Solution**: I simply searched "Orlando August 2024 beer sold" on Google. The first link led to a PDF document on an open FTP server, where I found the total number of gallons sold.

### **TommyCam**
- **Challenge**: In May 1995, university staff launched "TommyCam," a live video feed of the Tommy Trojan statue, which became a quirky campus favorite. The challenge was to find out what PC was initially used to run TommyCam, as listed in the first archived version of the USC.edu website from December 1996.
- **Solution**: I used the [Internet Archive's Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web) to look up the December 1996 version of the USC.edu website. There, I found a page on TommyCam, detailing the technical specs. The solution was a **Toshiba 5200 80386** PC.

### **Buildings**
- **Challenge**: I was given a PDF with images of various buildings, each represented by an acronym and a number. The task was to decode the flag by identifying each building's acronym and matching it with the correct number.
- **Solution**: Using Google Images, I matched each building acronym (like "EEB") with a letter (e.g., "3" corresponded to the letter "B" for EEB). By combining these letters, I deciphered the flag: **CYBORG{BRICKS}**.

### **television**
- **Challenge**: The challenge provided an image from the TV series *Perry Mason* (2020â€“2023), showing a building in the background. I needed to identify the real-life architect of this building.
- **Solution**: I reverse-searched the image on Google and found a more detailed version on the *Perry Mason* fandom page. After identifying the building in Los Angeles, I discovered that the architect was **Alfred H. Rosenheim**.
